# Self-Evolution Experiment

AI-Powered Ideation Framework with DeepSeek Integration

![Project Banner](https://example.com/path/to/banner.png) *(Optional: Add visual later)*

## Features

- **Structured Ideation Framework**: 6-stage process (0-5) for refining ideas
- **DeepSeek AI Integration**: Leverages `deepseek-chat` or `deepseek-reasoner` models
- **Automatic Self-Evaluation**: Scores responses against 5 quality metrics
- **Persistent Logging**: Stores all interactions in DuckDB database
- **Robust JSON Handling**: Specialized parsing for AI responses

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install openai duckdb
   ```

2. **Set API key**:
   ```bash
   export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
   ```

3. **Run the experiment**:
   ```bash
   python self_evolution_experiment.py
   ```

## Testing

We've implemented a robust testing framework to ensure reliability:

1. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

   # Install with test dependencies
   pip install -e ".[test]"

   # Execute tests with coverage reporting
   pytest tests/ -v --cov=self_evolution_experiment --cov-report=html
   ```

2. **View coverage report**:
   - Open `htmlcov/index.html` in a browser
   - Identifies untested code paths
   - Helps prioritize testing efforts

3. **Key test coverage**:
   - API communication (`chat` function)
   - Error handling
   - Core framework functionality
   - Database operations

## Recent Improvements

- Added comprehensive test coverage for API communication
- Resolved dependency compatibility issues
- Established reliable testing environment
- Improved overall test coverage from 0% to 23%

## Framework Stages

| Stage | Focus Area | Key Activities | Exit Rules |
|-------|------------|----------------|------------|
| 0 | Context Seed | Establish project foundation | [Success Today + Primary Constraint](#stage-0-exit-rules) |
| 1 | Brain Dump | Raw idea generation | [≥3 Key Themes](#stage-1-exit-rules) |
| 2 | Mind-Trace | Uncover hidden logic | [≥2 Patterns + Core Motivation](#stage-2-exit-rules) |
| 3 | Signal Scan | Deep dive & synthesis | [Winning Signal + ≥3 Micro-Steps](#stage-3-exit-rules) |
| 4 | Prototyping | Build quick tests | [Prototype Planning Package](#stage-4-exit-rules) |
| 5 | Implementation | Execute best ideas | TBD |

## Exit Rules

### Stage 0: Context Seed
**To advance**: AI must restate:
1. `Success Today: <one-sentence goal>`
2. `Primary Constraint: <one-sentence limitation>`

**Format Flexibility**:
- Supports Markdown (`**Success Today:**`, `### Primary Constraint:`)
- Case-insensitive (`SUCCESS TODAY:`, `primary constraint:`)

**Example**:
```markdown
Valid:
**Success Today:** Validate course outline
> Primary Constraint: Limited to 4 hours/week

Invalid:
"The goal is to finish the outline" (implied)
```

### Stage 1: Brain Dump
**To advance**: AI must identify ≥3 themes under `Key Themes:`

**Valid Formats**:
```markdown
Valid:
Key Themes:
1. **AI Education**
- Beginner onboarding
* Monetization

Invalid:
Key Themes: Various ideas (no list)
```

**Technical Note**:
- Regex: `r"Key Themes:.*?(\n\s*[-\*\d].+)+"`

### Stage 2: Mind-Trace
**To advance**: AI must document:
1. **≥2 Patterns** with:
   - `Pattern 1: <name>`
   - `Evidence: <quotes/examples>`
   - `Confidence: High/Medium/Low`
2. **Core Motivation**: `Core Motivation: <one-sentence>`
3. **Emotional Shift**: `Emotional Shift: <from X to Y>`

**Example**:
```markdown
Pattern 1: Problem-Solving as Identity
Evidence: "I jump from teaching to building tools"
Confidence: High

Core Motivation: To systematize mastery
Emotional Shift: Scattered → Focused
```

**Technical Notes**:
- Regex ignores whitespace/Markdown: `r"^\s*Pattern\s*\d+\s*:\s*.+"`
- [See implementation](self_evolution_experiment.py#L201)

### Stage 3: Signal Scan
**To advance**: AI must include the following sections exactly:
1. **Winning Signal:** One-sentence statement of the highest-energy idea.
2. **Emotional Mirror:** 1–2 sentences reflecting the user's expressed emotions.
3. **Micro-Sprint Plan:** At least **three** bullet-point steps that fit a ≤90-minute sprint.
   - An optional `Success Metric:` line is allowed.

**Valid Example**
```markdown
Winning Signal: The 3-day "AI-Proof Your Creative Career" workshop sparks the strongest pull.

Emotional Mirror: You're buzzing with creative energy but wrestling with overwhelm.

Micro-Sprint Plan:
1. Define Core Offer
2. Validate Demand via a poll
3. Sketch Day-1 Agenda
Success Metric: 50 poll votes in 24 h
```

*Invalid if any heading is missing or if fewer than 3 bullets appear in the Micro-Sprint Plan.*

**Technical Notes**
- Bullet detection regex: `r"(?:^|\n)\s*(?:[-*•‣—–]|\d+[.)])\s+"`
- Implementation: [`check_stage3_exit_rule`](self_evolution_experiment.py)

### Stage 4: Prototyping
**To advance**: AI must supply a **Prototype Planning Package** containing all four headings (order flexible):
1. **Prototype Goal:** Concise statement of what will be proven.
2. **Won't Build List:** Bulleted list with at least one non-scope item.
3. **Functional Checkpoint:** Single measurable test of success.
4. **Declare Completion:** Plain-language declaration that work is done.

**Valid Example**
```markdown
Prototype Goal: Interactive Figma of onboarding flow.

Won't Build List:
- Payment integration

Functional Checkpoint: User can navigate start→finish without dead ends.

Declare Completion: Prototype reviewed by 3 users scoring ≥80 % task success.
```

**Technical Notes**
- Regex checks each heading case-insensitively.
- Implementation: [`check_stage4_exit_rule`](self_evolution_experiment.py)

## Example Workflow

```plaintext
1. Select stage (e.g., 2 for Mind-Trace)
2. Enter prompt (end with EOF):
   "Why did I jump from X to Y?"
3. Receive AI analysis with patterns/motivation
4. Automatic evaluation → "Stage 2 Exit Rule Met"
5. Results logged to database
```

## Database Schema

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `timestamp` | TEXT | Interaction time |
| `stage` | INT | 0-5 |
| `exit_rule_met` | BOOL | True/False |
| `scores` | JSON | Clarity, alignment, etc. |

## Customization

Configure in script:
```python
# Model Selection
MODEL = "deepseek-chat"  # Alternatives: "deepseek-reasoner"

# Evaluation Rubric
RUBRIC = [
    ("clarity", "Is the response clear?"),
    ...
]
```

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues**:
- `API key not set`: Ensure DEEPSEEK_API_KEY is exported
- `JSON parse errors`: Check the debug output
- `Database issues`: Verify write permissions

## Roadmap

- [x] Stage 0-2 exit rules
- [x] Stage 3-4 exit rules (Signal Scan & Prototyping)
- [ ] Stage 5 exit rules
- [ ] Web interface
- [ ] Team collaboration

## Meta-Mode Enhancements

- **Scoring**: User meta-prompts aren't scored; only AI responses are evaluated
- **Database**: Interactions now track `is_meta` flag for analytics
- **JSON**: Self-evaluation requires lowercase 'json' in prompts

## Meta-Mode Detour

**Trigger Conditions**:
- Explicit request ("meta-mode", "zoom out")
- Implicit signals ("overwhelm", "stuck", "how did you decide")

**Protocol**:
1. AI acknowledges reflection state
2. Exposes reasoning (logic/data/constraints)
3. Provides concrete micro-action

**Example**:
```markdown
[META-INSIGHT] You've zoomed out to check hidden logic.
1. LOGIC: I surfaced pattern X because it recurred 3× in our last logs.
2. DATA: Your Stage 0 profile emphasized 'systematizing mastery'.
3. ACTION: Spend 5 min listing *one* blocker, then jump back to Stage 2.
```

**Database Impact**:
- Logged as `stage='meta'`
- Scores focus on clarity/empathy/utility

## Self-Evaluation

**Meta-Mode Evaluation**
When `is_meta=true`, the script uses a dedicated `META_RUBRIC` (insight_clarity, emotional_resonance, actionability) instead of the standard rubric. Scores are still logged in `self_scores` for data-driven pattern analysis of your reflective sessions.

# ── Meta-Mode Enhancements ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
### **Stage 5 (Meta-Mode) Refinements**
1. **Ambiguity Resolution Prompt**:
   - Guides AI to suggest three pathways for ambiguous tasks:
     - (a) Synthesize principles,
     - (b) Identify gaps,
     - (c) Wildcard insights from unrelated domains.
2. **Neutral-State Rubric**:
   - Scores how well the AI validates neutrality as a productive transitional state.
3. **Micro-Goal Generator**:
   - Breaks strategic pathways into atomic tasks (e.g., \"Spend 15 min finding one analogy\").

### **Testing**
- Run `self_evolution_experiment.py` and validate:
  - Ambiguity prompt outputs.
  - Neutrality validation in responses.
  - Clarity of micro-goals.

# AI Pair Programmer Database Operations Guidelines

## Context Setting Prompt

When working with database operations, always follow these steps:

**"Before suggesting any database commands, please:**

1. **Ask about the current working directory** - "What directory are you currently in? (`pwd` or `Get-Location`)"

2. **Confirm the database file location** - "Where is your database file located relative to your current directory?"

3. **Navigate first, then query** - Always suggest changing to the correct directory before running database commands:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/project
   duckdb database_name.db -c "YOUR_QUERY"
   ```

4. **Use relative paths when possible** - Once in the correct directory, use simple relative paths rather than complex absolute paths

5. **Verify the setup** - Before complex queries, suggest verifying the database exists and has the expected tables:
   ```bash
   duckdb database_name.db -c "SHOW TABLES;"
   ```

**Key principle: Always establish the correct working context before executing database operations.**

## Specific Database Command Pattern

For DuckDB operations in my projects:

1. Navigate to project root: `cd ideate_create`
2. List tables: `duckdb self_evo_logs.duckdb -c "SHOW TABLES;"`
3. Run queries: `duckdb self_evo_logs.duckdb -c "YOUR_SQL_QUERY;"`

**Never assume the current directory - always verify or navigate first!**

## Why This Matters

The AI pair programmer likely got confused because:
- It assumed you were in the project directory
- It didn't account for the fact that database files can exist in multiple locations
- It jumped straight to troubleshooting rather than establishing basic context
- It didn't follow the principle of "location first, operation second"

Use this prompt to set clear expectations about database operation workflows.

- **Solution**: Enhanced regex patterns capture content blocks rather than just headers
- **Result**: Successfully parsed complex nested structures

### 2. Content-Aware Validation  
- **Problem**: Headers without meaningful content passed validation
- **Solution**: Added content length (>50 chars) and meaningful line count checks
- **Result**: Only sections with substantial content marked as valid

### 3. Enhanced Debug Output
- **Problem**: Validation failures were difficult to troubleshoot
- **Solution**: Detailed logging shows exactly what content was found/missing
- **Result**: Clear visibility into validation process with line counts per section

## Technical Implementation

### Validation Logic
```python
# Content-aware section detection
match = re.search(pattern, ai_response, re.IGNORECASE | re.DOTALL)
if match:
    content = match.group(0)
    content_lines = [line.strip() for line in content.split('\n') if line.strip()]
    meaningful_lines = [line for line in content_lines[1:] if len(line) > 10]
    
    if meaningful_lines and content_length > 50:
        # Section validated as complete
```

### Debug Output Format
